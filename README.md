For my senior capstone my team is making a rhythm game.

I made this beat pattern editor by myself.
In this editor it saves patterns to a file, 
that file can be read at runtime.

IMPORTANT:
If there are any peoblems with the pattern not loading or saving try naming it another thing.
The string.Trim() might be messing with it in a weird way

IMPORTANT 2:
Make sure you click on "Select Beat Prefab" to create a beat, then you can modify it
